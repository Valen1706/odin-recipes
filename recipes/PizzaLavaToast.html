        <h1>Torta de Milanesa de Pollo</h1>

        <p>A simple toast covered with melty cheese toppings has been making the rounds on social media, but it's not just a slice of bread with some cheese melted on top. To give this toast the "lava" in its name, you actually stack two pieces of toast together to make a combination of grilled cheese and pizza toast.

            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
                <li>2 slices sourdough bread</li>
                <li>1 ½ ounces sliced mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 ounce sliced pepper jack cheese</li>
                <li>5 slices pickled jalapeno</li>
                <li>5 slices pepperoni</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pizza sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon italian seasoning, divided</li>
                <li>Crushed red pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. </li>
                <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>

                <li>Top with other slice of bread.</li>
                <li>Use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the middle of the bread slices, pushing down firmly to reach the bottom slice.</li>
                <li>Cover with remaining ½ ounce mozzarella cheese and pepper jack, followed by jalapeño and pepperoni.</li>
                <li>Garnish with remaining Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and golden-brown, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li>Slice in half and serve.</li>
